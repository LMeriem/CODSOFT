Credit Card Fraud Detection
Problem Statement
In today's digital world, credit card fraud is a significant issue that affects consumers and financial institutions alike. The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately detects fraudulent credit card transactions from a dataset containing transaction information. By classifying transactions as fraudulent or legitimate, we aim to minimize financial losses and enhance security measures.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from Kaggle:

Fraud Detection Dataset
The dataset contains various features related to credit card transactions, including:

Transaction details
Customer demographics
Information on whether the transaction was fraudulent
Solution Approach
Data Preprocessing:

Load and clean the dataset.
Convert categorical variables into numeric format using one-hot encoding.
Handle missing values using imputation methods.
Extract relevant time features from the transaction timestamp.
Balancing the Dataset:

Since fraudulent transactions are rare, apply SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset, ensuring that the model learns effectively from both classes.
Model Selection:

Experiment with various classification algorithms, including:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Model Evaluation:

Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
Implement Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning, particularly for the Random Forest model.
Model Interpretation:

Analyze model predictions and the importance of various features to understand factors contributing to fraudulent transactions.
Steps and Explanation
Import Libraries:

Import necessary libraries for data manipulation (Pandas, NumPy), model building (scikit-learn, XGBoost), and handling imbalanced datasets (imblearn).
Load and Explore Data:

Load the dataset from a CSV file and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and distribution of the data.
Preprocessing:

Clean column names, convert date features, drop unnecessary columns, and apply one-hot encoding to categorical features.
Handle missing values and apply SMOTE to create a balanced dataset.
Split the Data:

Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
Standardization:

Standardize the feature values for better model performance, especially for algorithms like Logistic Regression.
Model Training and Prediction:

Train different models on the training set and evaluate their performance on the test set using various classification metrics.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Use Grid Search with cross-validation to optimize the hyperparameters of the Random Forest classifier.
Evaluation:

Generate classification reports to summarize model performance.
